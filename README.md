Project Overview
This application predicts the price of used cars by analyzing various features including engine specifications, dimensions, mileage, and other attributes. Key objectives include:

Identifying key features influencing used car prices.
Handling outliers and adjusting feature distributions.
Building a reliable and user-friendly price prediction model.
Deploying the model via Streamlit for easy accessibility.
Dataset
The dataset comprises information on used cars with multiple features:

Basic Information: Model year, price, and brand.
Engine and Transmission: Engine type, power, torque, and displacement.
Dimensions & Capacity: Length, width, front tread, and wheel size.
Miscellaneous Features: Acceleration, top speed, and fuel capacity.
Data preprocessing involved:

Handling missing values.
Removing highly correlated features.
Addressing outliers using the IQR method.
Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Outlier Detection: Identified and addressed using IQR to ensure model robustness.
Correlation Analysis: Reduced features with a correlation threshold of 0.8, lowering dimensionality to essential features.
Final Features Selection: Reduced to 35 key features to optimize model performance.
Modeling
Multiple machine learning models were tested to select the most accurate and efficient predictor:

Algorithms Used: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Evaluation Metrics: Used RMSE, MAE, and R-squared to compare model performance.
Application Deployment
The final model is integrated into a Streamlit app, allowing users to:

Input car details and receive price predictions.
Visualize feature importances and predictions with interactive elements.
